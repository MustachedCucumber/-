PLZ READ BEFORE INTERACTING IN PONY TOWN 

SO UH HI HELLO HOWDY!!!!

Please do not start conversations with me on pony town or especially try to befriend me, i have REALLY SERIOUS jealousy & attachment issues, seeing someone i've talked to only like 2-3 times talk to other friends or mention someone else can cause me physical pain, and from my experience, i know that even if i tell someone about my issues and ask them to not mention others when talking to me, it gets totally ignored and it influences me *really badly*, so don't get offended if i won't chat with you, it's for the better, and no, i also won't wanna be your friend if you tell me you won't talk about others, i've been there before and people are just liars. Of course, i'm fine with a simple "hello", complimenting my skin or saying something like "OMG A *insert some cool media* FAN!!", but nothing more.

• i'm usually online everyday for a couple of minutes, just wandering around/sitting somewhere, hoping to find someone from my fandoms to boop 'em and compliment their skin

• i'm totally okay with any kind of touching, and by that i mean booping, cuddling, kissing, covering and stuff like that, it's actually so wholesome PLEASE DO IT RAHHHHH

• wanna copy my skin? i don't mind it either, just busting my ego a bit, cuz it means that ya like my skin so yeahhh

• OH AND BTW, if i see you sitting with your friend/friends somewhere in pony town, there's no way i'm gonna respond to anything, i despise friend groups and no force can make me join a conversation with someone's friend group
