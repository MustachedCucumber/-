• i'm usually online everyday for a couple of minutes, just wandering around/sitting somewhere, hoping to find someone from my fandoms to boop 'em and compliment their skin

• i'm totally okay with any kind of touching, and by that i mean booping, cuddling, kissing, covering and stuff like that, it's actually so wholesome PLEASE DO IT RAHHHHH

• wanna copy my skin? i don't mind it either, just inflating my ego a bit, cuz it means that ya like my skin so yeahhh

• and finally 'bout chatting with me, i'm okay with just simply saying "hello", complimenting my skin or stuff like "OMG A *insert some media* FAN!!!!" but i'm not open for any longer chats and especially not for making friends, if i see anyone trying to chat about something with me or befriend me, i'm just gonna disappear, and nuh uh, there are no exceptions ;] i just have my reasons, don't take it personally.

• OH AND BTW, if i see you sitting with your friend/friends somewhere in pony town, there's no way i'm gonna respond to anything, i despise friend groups and no force can make me join a conversation with someone's friend group
